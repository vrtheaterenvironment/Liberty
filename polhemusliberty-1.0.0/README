Polhemus Liberty (v2) (tm) Motion Tracker driver for Linux

This driver supports the Polhemus Liberty v2 using its USB2 interface to
transmit tracking data at 240Hz.

Please find new releases at Sourceforge:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/polhemusliberty/

This driver has two parts: 
 - Firmware loader (scripts for udev and the firmware)
 - A library based on libUSB that communicates with the motion tracker


Dependencies:
 - fxload  (to load the firmware onto the USB device)
 - libusb-dev  (userspace USB programming library development files
   Library for programming USB applications without the knowledge
   of Linux kernel internals.)

In Debian GNU/Linux, simply install them by typing:
    sudo apt-get install fxload libusb-dev


Follow the instructions in the firmware_load directory to install the udev
configuration files, and firmware files.  Then run make in the 'src'
directory.  Execute the program:

./liberty2

It should detect the motion tracker, how many sensors are attached to it,
and start printing the position/orientation data to stdout

To record to a file, the following is enough:

./liberty2 > motion_recording.txt

Note: Connect the first sensor to input #1, and the rest to the following
inputs.  Do not leave a sensor input empty in between.  For example, for
three sensors, use inputs #1, #2, #3, and not #1, #2, #5.

If you wish to make your own programs, you can use liberty.c and liberty.h,
as they handle all the low level communication to the Polhemus Liberty v2
(tm) device and offer a nice API.

We developed this driver as a part of the Cognition for Technical Systems
(CoTeSys) project (http://www.cotesys.org), working at the Technische
Universitaet Muenchen, at the chair for intelligent autonomous systems
(http://www9.cs.tum.edu).  Collaborators: Alexis Maldonado, Federico Ruiz,
Jonathan Kleinehellefort, and Ingo Kresse, under the supervision of Prof. 
Michael Beetz, PhD.
